    "This tutorial will walk you through a preliminary similarity searching analysis making use of scripts in the AMOEBAE toolkit. As a simple example, we will consider the the distribution of orthologues of subunits of the Adaptor Protein (AP) 2 vesicle adaptor complex, and several other membrane-trafficking proteins, in three model eukaryotes: the plant *Arabidopsis thaliana*, the yeast *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*, the fungus *Allomyces macrogynus*, the amoeba *Dictyostelium discoideum*, and the pathogenic protist *Trypanosoma brucei*. AP-2 subunits are homologous to subunits of other AP complexes (Robinson, 2004; Hirst et al., 2011), and published work has traced their evolution among plants (Larson et al., 2019), Fungi (Barlow et al., 2014), and trypanosomatid parasites (Manna et al., 2013). Thus, the protein subunits of the AP-2 complex provide a useful test of similarity searching methods to distinguish between orthologues and paralogues, which can be compared to the results of previous comprehensive studies. The membrane trafficking proteins Sec12 (a component of the COPII vesicle coat complex), SNAP33 (a Qbc-SNARE), and Rab2 (a small GTPase) are included to further explore the potential sources of error involved in identification of orthologous proteins. The end result of running this code successfully is a spreadsheet summarizing results of similarity searches, as well as a plot summarizing the results.\n",

    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Perform similarity searches using the BLASTP, TBLASN, HMMer algorithms simultaneously using AMOBEAE code.\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Apply a reciprocal-best-hit search strategy using AMOEBAE code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Practice interpreting interesting similarity search results obtained using AMOEBAE.\n",
    " \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Requirements\n",
    "\n",
    "- MacOS or Linux operating system (or possibly a work-around on windows, although this has not been tested).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Before running this code, you will need to have set up AMOEBAE according to the instructions in the main documentation file.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The code in this notebook will take approximately <span style=\"color:red\">XXXXXX</span> minutes to run."

    "In this tutorial, a reciprocal-best-hit search strategy will be used. If you are using a reciprocal- best-hit search strategy, then your initial round of searches will be performed using your original queries (assembled above) to search your genomes of interest. This initial round of searches will be referred to herein as \"forward searches\", and subsequent searches using forward search hits as queries into reference genomes will be referred to as \"reverse searches\".\n",
    "\n",
    "A slight complication to this search strategy is that the NCBI RefSeq peptide sequences for the A. thaliana genome include alternative transcripts and lineage-specific inparalogues (as do other databases), implying that if these were retrieved as the top hits in the reverse searches instead of the original query sequence, then this would still potentially be a positive result. So, to properly interpret reverse search results it will be necessary to determine which sequences in our A. thaliana .faa file are redundant for our purposes. To do this we will use the get_redun_hits command:"

Subplot sectors with blue fill indicate that one or more sequences were found to meet the search criteria applied (with the number being indicated within each subplot sector). Note that the ancestral eukaryotic AP-1 and AP-2 complexes shared a single beta subunit (Dacks et al., 2008). This is why identified \"AP1beta\" orthologues are shown as a component of the AP-2 complex here, even though T. brucei lacks an AP-2 complex (Manna et al., 2013).

    "It should be clear that AMOEBAE identifies \"positive\" and \"negative\" results simply by applying criteria that the user specifies. So, it is entirely the users responsibility to select appropriate criteria and interpret the results critically.\n",
    "\n",
    "Points to consider regarding interpretation of the results of the analysis in this tutorial include the following:\n",
    "- The BLASTP and HMMer searches (both followed by reverse BLASTP searches) yielded the same results in this analysis.\n",
    "- The TBLASTN searches were able to identify all of the genes represented by the peptide sequences identified by BLASTP and HMMer searches.\n",
    "- A TBLASTN hit in the A. thaliana chromosome 5 (NC_003076.8) met the forward and reverse search criteria, but was excluded because the translation of the region that aligned to the query was only 50 amino acids long (this sequence also contained stop codons). If you look on the NCBI genome browser for A. thaliana you will see that this region on chromosome 5 (as indicated in the summary CSV file) corresponds to a pseudogene for AP-2 sigma with the gene ID AT5G42568.\n",
    "- The two A. thaliana AP-1/2 beta paralogues and the two S. cerevisiae paralogues are brassicalid and fungal inparalogues, respectively, which arose from independent gene duplications. Phylogenetic analysis would be required to determine this (see Larson et al. (2019) and Barlow et al. (2014)).\n",
    "- An Arabidopsis thaliana AP-2 mu splice variant was excluded after running the ’find _redun_seqs’ command, because it was found to be encoded by the same gene as the other splice variant based on information in the GFF3 annotation file.\n",
    "- An A. thaliana AP-2 alpha gene was excluded after running the ’find_redun_seqs’ command, because it shows over 98% identity with the other AP-2 alpha gene. The summary CSV file indicates which file contains an alignment of these two sequences (see Larson et al. (2019) for relevant discussion).\n",
    "\n",
    "If the analysis in this tutorial were a project you were working on for publication, then upon completing the above analysis steps you work would have only just begun. AMOEBAE merely finds sequences that match your specified search criteria, which may or may not be sufficient to accurately identify homologues of interest. Careful inspection of the summary CSV file will reveal that minor adjustments to the search criteria would cause the analysis to yield different results. Moreover, there are many different possibilities that would lead to innacurate results based on the criteria applied in the above analysis. A comprehensive discussion of this is beyond the scope of this tutorial, but one obvious example would be if an identified sequence contained a domain that was not present in the query sequence, causing sequences to be retrieved in the reverse search with no homology to the original query. Therefore, it is recommended that you commit to an iterative approach to analysis involving adjustment of search criteria and re-analysis to include sequences that you know are homologues of interest, but to exclude those that you know are not homologues of interest.\n",
