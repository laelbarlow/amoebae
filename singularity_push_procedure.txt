Procedure for pushing a new Singularity container image to the Sylabs Cloud
container library.

Rationale: It's a better place to store built singularity containers than
GitHub, due to the file size, and users can download them quickly. 

1. Log into account at https://cloud.sylabs.io/home.

2. Navigate to amoebae containers.

3. Click "Push A New Image".

4. Generate new access token and save to clipboard.

5. On macOS, navigate to amoebae repository in Terminal.

6. Spin up a virtual machine running linux:

    vagrant up

7. Log into the virtual machine:

    vagrant ssh

8. Copy the (updated) singularity.sif file to the virtual machine:
    
    cp amoebae/singularity.sif singularity.sif

9. Enter this command to sign the image, and follow prompts:

    singularity sign singularity.sif

10. Enter this command to push the image to the Sylabs library:

    singularity push singularity.sif library://laelbarlow/default/amoebae:latest

11. Depending on the day/time, upload may be extremely slow. Try again later if
necessary.

12. Log out of the virtual machine:

    exit

13. Delete the virtual machine (and the redundant copy of the .sif file):
    
    vagrant destroy
