Procedure for pushing a new Singularity container image to the Sylabs Cloud
container library.

Rationale: It's a better place to store built singularity containers than
GitHub, due to the file size, and users can download them quickly. 

1. On macOS, navigate to amoebae repository in Terminal.

2. Spin up a virtual machine running linux:

    vagrant up

3. Log into the virtual machine:

    vagrant ssh

4. Copy the (updated) singularity.sif file to the virtual machine:
    
    cp amoebae/singularity.sif singularity.sif

5. Enter this command to sign the image, and follow prompts:

    singularity sign singularity.sif

6. Log into account at https://cloud.sylabs.io/home.

7. Navigate to amoebae containers.

8. Click "Push A New Image".

9. Generate new access token and save to clipboard, and paste to the Terminal
window.

10. Enter this command to push the image to the Sylabs library:

    singularity push singularity.sif library://laelbarlow/default/amoebae:latest

11. Depending on the day/time, upload may be extremely slow. Try again later if
necessary.

12. Log out of the virtual machine:

    exit

13. Delete the virtual machine (and the redundant copy of the .sif file):
    
    vagrant destroy
